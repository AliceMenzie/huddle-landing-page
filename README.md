### What I learned

This is my first time using styled components, I really enjoyed it! 

I followed this [Turotial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02zO0hZmwnw) by Brad Travery, It was a super helpful tutorial and went through most of the project,
 I was able to go through at then end and add in some bits he didn't go through and make any changes.
